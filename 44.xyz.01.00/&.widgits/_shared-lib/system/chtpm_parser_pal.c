// TPM CHTPM Parser (v3.6 - PROJECT LOADER FIX)
// Responsibility: 100% Warning-free, app-aware routing and variables.

/* chtpm_parser_pal.c - SHARED OP (yz.muchiverse/2.muchi-verse/shared-ops/,
 * see chtpm-to-pal-layout-plan.txt for the why) - a TRACKED FORK of real
 * 1.TPMOS's own pieces/chtpm/plugins/chtpm_parser.c, not a rewrite.
 *
 * WHY A FORK, NOT A FROM-SCRATCH PORT: empirically tested (compiled the
 * real file completely unmodified, ran it in an empty scratch dir
 * against a hand-authored .chtpm file, no other 1.TPMOS infrastructure
 * present) - it parses/renders/dispatches correctly with ZERO source
 * changes, writing to the exact pieces/display/current_frame.txt path
 * pal renderers already use. The real blockers were a couple of small,
 * concrete integration gaps, not an architectural mismatch - patched
 * below, each one named, none silent. Unlike prisc+x's own
 * one-shot-per-tick ops, this is a PERSISTENT process (its own main()
 * polling loop) - that's not new to this family: system/renderer.c and
 * system/gl_mirror.c are already long-running side-processes
 * alongside prisc+x, this is the same category.
 *
 * THE INPUT-READING SIDE IS NOT PATCHED AT ALL, ON PURPOSE: this
 * file's own main() loop keeps reading pieces/keyboard/history.txt in
 * its real, original "KEY_PRESSED: N" format, unmodified. Instead the
 * bridge lives on the PAL side, in keyboard_input.c (a small file
 * already copied per-project in this family, not a 3000-line vendored
 * file) - its own append_key() now ALSO appends "KEY_PRESSED: N\n" to
 * pieces/keyboard/history.txt alongside its original bare-int write to
 * pieces/apps/player_app/history.txt (which prisc+x's own
 * OP_READ_HISTORY still reads exactly as before - zero change to any
 * existing pal script's own read_history calls). Smaller, more
 * surgical diff against this file specifically, which matters for
 * "steal more pieces from upstream as needed" later.
 *
 * THE 2 PATCHES THAT DO LIVE IN THIS FILE (search "PAL-NATIVE PATCH"
 * for each exact site):
 * 1. is_modern_layout() - real 1.TPMOS detects "is this a modern
 *    layout" by guessing from substrings in the layout's own path
 *    ("editor", "desktop", ...). Replaced the guessing with an
 *    explicit, real signal already used everywhere else in this pal
 *    family: the PRISC_PROJECT_ID env var every project's own
 *    button.sh already exports (same var pet_export.c's own
 *    resolve_game_id() reads - not a new convention invented here).
 * 2. inject_command() - CRITICAL correctness fix, not a style choice:
 *    real 1.TPMOS's pal-adjacent branch appends "COMMAND: %s\n" to
 *    the SAME pieces/apps/player_app/history.txt file prisc+x's own
 *    OP_READ_HISTORY reads. Confirmed by reading prisc+x.c directly:
 *    OP_READ_HISTORY does fseek+fscanf("%d") and, on a non-numeric
 *    line, LEAVES ITS OWN CURSOR REGISTER UNCHANGED - it does not
 *    skip past the bad line, it gets stuck re-reading the same byte
 *    offset forever. Writing a "COMMAND: ..." line into that file
 *    would permanently wedge any project's own pal-driven key
 *    reading. Fixed by writing onClick-dispatched commands to a
 *    SEPARATE file, pieces/display/pending_command.txt, for
 *    pal-native projects - a project's own pal script (or a small
 *    companion op) reads that file for its own small, closed set of
 *    onClick verbs. This deliberately does NOT try to be one
 *    universal verb dispatcher (see chtpm-to-pal-layout-plan.txt §4
 *    for why real 1.TPMOS's own send_command() grew into exactly that
 *    anti-pattern, one silently-dropped-prefix bug at a time).
 *
 * WHAT'S DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED (still real 1.TPMOS behavior, not
 * gaps): load_vars()'s existing pieces/apps/player_app/state.txt +
 * .../manager/state.txt loading already fires unconditionally
 * whenever is_modern_layout() is true - this is already a generic,
 * project-agnostic "vars bridge" (plain key=value, same format every
 * pal project's own state.txt already uses) - a pal project wanting a
 * layout to see a ${var} just writes it to one of those two files, no
 * parser patch needed. launch_module()'s fork/exec-a-persistent-child
 * mechanism is untouched and inert unless a layout uses <module> tags
 * - no pal-native layout should use them yet (see plan doc §4).
 * inject_raw_key()'s pal-native behavior is NOT yet decided (would it
 * double-dispatch through both prisc+x's own pal script AND this
 * process's process_key()?) - deliberately left as real upstream
 * behavior for now since no pal-native layout uses onClick="KEY:n"
 * yet; flagged here, not silently assumed safe.
 *
 * BUILD FLAGS: real 1.TPMOS's own build never enabled -Wextra, so this
 * file carries ~20 pre-existing, real-upstream warnings this fork
 * inherited (asprintf/chdir/system return-value-ignored, several
 * strncpy truncation-risk sites) - none touched by either of the 2
 * patches above, all pre-existing upstream behavior. Individually
 * pragma-wrapping ~20 scattered sites in vendored code this session
 * doesn't own the logic of was judged worse than one explicit,
 * documented compile-line exception: build this ONE file (only) with
 * -Wno-unused-result -Wno-stringop-truncation in addition to this
 * family's usual -Wall -Wextra. Every project's own scripts/build.sh
 * must add both flags on this file's own compile line - confirmed via
 * a real test build this gets to zero warnings.

 * (a project's own directly-declared <interact> target, or the

/* XYZOS-STANDARDS sec. 0 (FOUNDATIONAL CORRECTION - SYNCHRONOUS INTERACT
 * DISPATCH): real/classic chtpm invokes an op SYNCHRONOUSLY per
 * keypress (fork/exec/waitpid, done and finished before the next
 * render - confirmed via direct read of real fuzz-op_manager.c's own
 * `execl(move_entity_trait, ...); waitpid(p, NULL, 0);` pattern). The
 * OLD design here (process_key()'s own INTERACT branch calling
 * inject_raw_key() to relay a key into interact_relay.txt, for a
 * PERSISTENT `system/prisc+x` process launched once via launch_module()
 * to pick up on its OWN independent poll loop) was never an intentional
 * deviation from that - direct correction: "mutaclysm isn't real time
 * nor is the deviation deliberate ... never assume we meant to deviate
 * from classic chtpm standards other than 2 use more pal." That
 * unsynchronized, two-process design is the root cause of an entire
 * class of races documented elsewhere in xyzos-standards.txt (sec. 16.3,
 * 17) - dispatch and render were never actually causally ordered, only
 * eventually-consistent across two independently-timed poll loops.
 *
 * This function restores the real, synchronous model: write the key
 * DIRECTLY (truncate, not append - exactly one value, no accumulation)
 * to the SAME target inject_raw_key() would use, then fork/exec/WAIT
 * (blocking) for current_module_path to run to completion before
 * returning. The pal-native module program it runs is a ONE-SHOT
 * program (main_loop_chtpm.pal in mutaclsym/zoo_0000 - no loop, exits
 * naturally when pc reaches the end) that reads this exact key,
 * dispatches the real action, and calls compose_frame/hit_frame itself
 * - by the time this function returns, view.txt/current_frame.txt are
 * already fully up to date, so chtpm's own subsequent render (the
 * existing frame_changed.txt marker write later in process_key()) shows
 * fresh state immediately. No relay file polling, no second process,
 * no lag window between "key relayed" and "state updated" to race
 * against. */

     * real one), killing and relaunching an ALREADY-ALIVE, perfectly
     * fine persistent module on EVERY single screen switch - confirmed

 * ever set by THIS file's own key-handling code (the Enter-on-a-
 * locally-focused-INTERACT-element branch). It has zero connection to
 * is_map_control (wraith-alpha_manager.c's actual authoritative state
 * for "is this project's INTERACT mode genuinely engaged right now"),
 * so any activation that happens via a path chtpm_parser.c doesn't
 * itself witness -- a GL mouse click on the button, routed through
 * wraith_gl.c's hit-test -> wraith-alpha_manager.c's
 * dispatch_menu_index()/route_command(), entirely bypassing this
 * file -- correctly sets is_map_control=1 and correctly starts
 * forwarding keys (bug #11's fix), but never touches this file's
 * active_index, so ASCII's own glyph never updated to match. Same root
 * shape as bug #12 (GL's OWN separate glyph function had the identical
 * gap, fixed there via a project-scoped is_map_control read) -- fixed
 * here the same way: get_var("project_id") reflects whichever embedded
 * project is currently focused (this file only ever renders one
 * focused project's embedded body in detail at a time, matching the
 * desktop's own "Focus: <window>" invariant), so read that project's
 * own session/state.txt directly, same file/key

         * (USER-PAL-STANDARD.txt sec. 4) can populate a field before
         * the player ever typed anything, so the very first frame a
         * player sees may already have lost the label. Direct user
         * report: "i dont want it to default to saying 'jb'... it
         * should say <field-name> next to cli-io inputs." Deliberate
         * DIVERGENCE from real chtpm_parser.c here (confirmed by direct

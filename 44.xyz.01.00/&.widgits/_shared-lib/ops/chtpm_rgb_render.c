/* chtpm_rgb_render - SHARED, PERSISTENT process (yz.muchiverse/
 * 2.muchi-verse/shared-ops/, see !.handoff-doc-j17.txt and
 * chtpm-to-pal-layout-plan.txt §8/§2 in that handoff doc for the full
 * why). Same category as system/renderer.c/system/gl_mirror.c already
 * are in this family - a long-running daemon, NOT a one-shot pal op
 * invoked from a .pal script.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS: real 1.TPMOS's own wraith_rgb_daemon.c
 * (projects/wraith-alpha/plugins/), confirmed via direct code read,
 * does something genuinely simple: it watches pieces/display/
 * frame_changed.txt, reads pieces/display/current_frame.txt (the FULL
 * ASCII text chtpm_parser.c composed - chrome AND embedded content,
 * everything), and font-rasterizes EVERY CHARACTER OF IT into an
 * RGBA32 buffer - confirmed explicitly by that project's own
 * architecture doc: "Does NOT parse .chtpm... does not recognize
 * <cli_io>, <button>, <text> tags." Zero semantic awareness of
 * buttons/panels - it just blits whatever characters are already
 * there. This is the ENTIRE reason real 1.TPMOS's own GL window shows
 * chtpm's own menu chrome: the chrome is literally IN the text buffer
 * already, and every character gets rasterized, full stop.
 *
 * THIS FILE is the pal-native equivalent - same shape, same job.
 * `ops/compose_rgb_frame.c` (per-project, already exists in mutaclsym/
 * zoo_0000) does something DIFFERENT: it draws real 2D TILE graphics
 * (walls/furniture as actual colored tiles) directly from game-state
 * files, never touching current_frame.txt at all - which is exactly
 * why chtpm's own chrome never appeared in the GL window before this
 * file existed. `load_glyphs()`/`blit_char()`/`blit_text()` below are
 * a DIRECT PORT of the identically-named, identically-shaped functions
 * already in `ops/compose_rgb_frame.c` (which itself already ported
 * them from real wraith_rgb_daemon.c - see that file's own header
 * comment) - NOT reinvented, just re-purposed to rasterize the WHOLE
 * buffer instead of one footer line.
 *
 * WHY 640x768, NOT 640x304 (real, direct user report, not guessed):
 * this file used to match system/gl_mirror.c's own then-HARDCODED
 * `#define WIDTH 640` / `#define HEIGHT 304`, reasoning that reusing
 * its existing fixed expectation was lower-risk than changing it. That
 * reasoning turned out wrong in practice - a real chtpm frame
 * (chrome + embedded ${game_map} + status/inventory/message-log +
 * footer) is genuinely ~35 lines tall (confirmed via direct count of a
 * live current_frame.txt), while 304px/GLYPH_H(16) only ever fit 19 -
 * the bottom of the map and most of the footer were being silently
 * clipped every single frame, not just at the edges. gl_mirror.c now
 * reads frame_w/frame_h from rgb_frame.receipt.txt DYNAMICALLY (same
 * pattern shared-ops/dump_rgb_png.c already used successfully) instead
 * of hardcoding them, so this file is free to size itself for its own
 * real content instead of an unrelated fixed constant. 48 rows (768px)
 * gives real headroom above the observed ~35-line maximum (message log
 * can grow to LOG_TAIL=4 lines, footers vary) without being wasteful.
 * Width stays 640 (80 GLYPH_W(8) columns) - already confirmed generous
 * against the longest real chrome line (~72 chars).
 *
 * Writes pieces/display/rgb_frame.raw + rgb_frame.receipt.txt - the
 * SAME paths system/gl_mirror.c and shared-ops/dump_rgb_png.c already
 * read. "One state, multiple renderers": whichever process last wrote
 * rgb_frame.raw wins - ops/compose_rgb_frame.c's own real tile
 * graphics in regular "run" mode (still exactly 640x304, its own
 * unrelated game-viewport-derived size, untouched by this change), or
 * this daemon's text rasterization in "chtpm" mode - gl_mirror.c reads
 * whichever size the CURRENT receipt says, correctly handling either. */

/* REAL emoji rendering, NOT a hash fallback - direct user correction
 * ("wraith-alpha renders rgb emojis just fine. why can we do what that
 * is doing? you should copy wraith-alpha as much as possible"). An
 * earlier version of this file stopped at flat colors only
 * (utf8_hash_color(), still below, now truly a last resort), reasoning
 * that wraith_rgb_daemon.c's own architecture doc saying it "does not
 * recognize <cli_io>/<button>/<text> tags" meant it didn't render real
 * emoji pixels either - WRONG, those are different claims. Real
 * wraith_rgb_daemon.c has zero .chtpm/tag awareness AND still renders
 * real emoji pixel art, via blit_codepoint()/get_emoji_bitmap()/
 * load_emoji_bitmap_from_disk() - a genuine 2-stage, offline-first
 * pipeline (real FreeType rasterization done ONCE by a separate tool,
 * the daemon just blits the pre-generated bitmap at runtime) - already
 * documented in ops/compose_rgb_frame.c's own header comment (which
 * ported the SAME mechanism for regular "run" mode), just never
 * applied here.
 *
 * This file now does the same, adapted the same way compose_rgb_frame.c
 * already adapted it: reuses THIS project's own pre-generated
 * pieces/registry/emoji_assets/<asset_id>/voxels_16.csv files (real
 * 16x16 RGBA pixel data, FreeType-rasterized once, not per-frame) -
 * see load_emoji_voxels()/blit_emoji_tile() below, ported directly
 * from compose_rgb_frame.c's own identically-named functions.
 *
 * THE ONE REAL DIFFERENCE FROM compose_rgb_frame.c's OWN LOOKUP: that
 * file keys emoji_assets/<asset_id>/ off its own INTERNAL single-char
 * terrain/furniture type code (read straight from game state), which
 * this file doesn't have - it only ever sees the ALREADY-RENDERED
 * emoji BYTES in current_frame.txt. Since every registry row already
 * maps id<->unicode 1:1, this builds the REVERSE lookup (unicode bytes
 * -> asset_id) once at startup by reading the SAME registries, instead
 * of receiving asset_id directly - a real, necessary adaptation for a
 * text-only-input daemon, not a shortcut. Covers all four registries
 * that have real emoji_assets/ entries (confirmed via directory
 * listing): terrain, furniture, items, monsters - the first two also
 * carry a real curated `rgb_top_emoji` flat color (used as the tile's
 * base color the voxel art is blitted on top of, matching
 * compose_rgb_frame.c's own exact layering); items/monsters have no
 * such field (per those registries' own header comments - "items/
 * monsters already fall back to the same flat glyph_fallback_rgb()
 * regardless of this toggle - a pre-existing limitation"), so they get
 * a neutral dark backdrop instead, real voxel art still on top. */

     * and writes current_frame.txt (the actual content) as two
     * SEPARATE, unsynchronized writes - real 1.TPMOS code this project
     * keeps a deliberately minimal-diff fork of (see shared-ops/
     * chtpm_parser_pal.c's own header comment on its "exactly 2
     * patches" policy), not something to patch further for this. The
     * old code here rendered the INSTANT it saw the pulse grow, which
     * could catch current_frame.txt mid-write (confirmed live: a
     * render right after an Enter-triggered pulse growth showed a
     * MIX of the old and new footer text). A first fix used a fixed
     * 30ms delay after the pulse changed - a real improvement (direct
     * user confirmation: "no where near as bad"), but not fully
     * robust, since it's a blind delay tied to an UNRELATED file
     * (frame_changed.txt), not an actual check on current_frame.txt
     * itself. Checked real wraith_rgb_daemon.c directly, per explicit
     * instruction, for a better pattern to copy - it has NEITHER an
     * atomic write NOR any settle delay at all (`main()`'s own loop
     * renders the instant its trigger file changes, no grace period)
     * - this exact race is LATENT in real wraith-alpha too, not
     * something to copy from there; its own upstream writer likely
     * just finishes fast enough in practice to rarely expose it.
     *
     * REAL FIX: wait for current_frame.txt ITSELF to stop changing
     * size, not a fixed delay on a proxy file - poll its own size
     * repeatedly until it reads the same value twice in a row (capped
     * at 20 attempts / ~200ms so a genuinely stuck writer can't hang
     * this daemon forever) before reading its content. Directly
     * verifies the actual thing being read is done changing, rather
     * than guessing how long that takes. */

/* x11_mirror - REAL SHARED BINARY (2026-08-17, khtpm-merge-how2.md
 * §5c.1/§5c.6, legacy-shared-fix.md §3) - one compiled binary, launched
 * by every legacy-GL project (mutaclysm/piececraft-xyz/my-chara-txt so
 * far, more to follow), replacing each project's own separate
 * gl_mirror.c copy. Real, deliberate move away from the earlier
 * per-project-copy pilot (mutaclysm's own original x11_mirror.c, now
 * superseded by this file) once direct instruction confirmed the goal
 * was "they should all use 1 same binary" - this file was ALREADY
 * nearly generic (every real path already derived from project_root),
 * so becoming the shared binary needed only genericizing the window
 * TITLE (see g_title/derive_title() below), not a rewrite.
 *
 * PARAMETERIZATION: window title is derived from basename(project_root)
 * (e.g. launched against ".../101.mutaclsym.../ " -> title
 * "101.mutaclsym... RGB mirror") - zero new config needed, and a real,
 * direct correctness win: piececraft-xyz's own OLD gl_mirror.c had a
 * stale, copy-pasted title ("tactics-txt RGB mirror" - wrong project
 * name entirely), so basename-derivation isn't just "good enough", it
 * actively FIXES a real pre-existing bug rather than preserving it. The
 * focus_lock file's own "project=" line (cosmetic only - confirmed no
 * real reader parses its content, only checks the file's EXISTENCE) is
 * derived the same way for consistency, not because anything depends
 * on it.
 *
 * REAL, ORIGINAL PILOT CONTEXT (2026-08-17, khtpm-merge-how2.md §5c.1)
 * of gl_mirror.c away from GL/GLUT to plain Xlib, per direct
 * instruction: "khtpmos's real X11 approach... now supersedes [GL] as
 * the house's actual preferred display technology." mutaclysm was the
 * first of 16 real gl_mirror.c copies converted - user asked to watch
 * that one directly before the rest got delegated.
 *
 * Job is UNCHANGED from gl_mirror.c: poll ops/compose_rgb_frame.+x's
 * output file (pieces/display/rgb_frame.raw, raw RGBA32, zero GL/X11
 * calls went into producing those bytes) and blit it into a window.
 * Only the FINAL DISPLAY STEP changed - same file-watch pulse, same
 * checksum algorithm, same receipt schema (so this pipeline's
 * correctness is still confirmed by reading a text file, not by eyes
 * on the screen), same keyboard/mouse forwarding, same focus-lock
 * mechanism, same drop-import queue. Ported line-by-line against
 * gl_mirror.c, not reinvented - see that file's own comment for the
 * real history/reasoning behind each of these pieces.
 *
 * REAL, DOCUMENTED SCOPE NARROWING vs. gl_mirror.c (flagged here, not
 * hidden): gl_mirror.c let the user freely resize the window to any
 * aspect ratio and letterboxed the texture inside it (update_texture_
 * viewport()'s aspect-fit math). This first pass keeps the X11 window's
 * size locked 1:1 to the frame's own real pixel size at all times (same
 * as gl_mirror.c already does via glutReshapeWindow() on every frame-
 * size CHANGE - the only thing dropped is manual free-resize-by-drag-
 * to-an-arbitrary-aspect). This keeps XPutImage a plain 1:1 blit with
 * no software scaling, so the FNV-1a-64 checksum this file writes is a
 * direct, exact comparison against gl_mirror.c's own real receipts -
 * the strongest, most literal proof-of-parity available for a pilot
 * conversion. Manual free-resize + letterbox can be added back as a
 * real follow-up (software scaling into the XImage before XPutImage)
 * once this base pipeline is confirmed correct - not needed for parity
 * proof itself.
 *
 * REAL FOLLOW-UP (2026-08-17, direct live report: "it still has gl
 * header... eventually we want to use our own header" - the point being
 * a plain OS-decorated window LOOKS identical whether GL or X11 is
 * underneath, so there was no visible signal the conversion had
 * happened): added the same custom chrome-bar treatment already proven
 * on db-hq/events-hq/chat-hai this session (_MOTIF_WM_HINTS
 * decorations=0 + a real, hand-drawn Xft title bar + drag-by-chrome-bar
 * via ButtonPress/MotionNotify/ButtonRelease) instead of relying on the
 * native WM titlebar. This IS the real, intended "you can tell it
 * converted" signal per direct instruction - not cosmetic polish. */

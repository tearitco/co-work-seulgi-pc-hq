/* khtpm_render_core.c — Stage 2a of the khtpm merge (au11-hq/
 * khtpm-merge-how2.md), 2026-08-16. Canonical source for the pieces of
 * the Elem/parse_chtpm() rendering model that are genuinely
 * byte-identical or functionally identical across the 3 apps that
 * actually share this architecture:
 *   khtpm_hq_render.c (db-hq), khtpm_events_hq_render.c (events-hq),
 *   chat_hai_hq_render.c (chat-hai).
 *
 * REAL FIX 2026-08-16, direct correction ("we try not to use headers
 * cept from cross os shims"): this was originally written as a .h with
 * `static inline` functions - a NEW in-house header, which this house
 * avoids (checked the real reference, 1.TPMOS_c_+rmmp.0103.0001/
 * projects/wraith-alpha/ops/*.c - zero in-house headers anywhere, only
 * system headers, with `#ifdef _WIN32 ... #else #include <unistd.h>
 * #endif`-shaped blocks being the one legitimate exception). Converted
 * to a plain .c file with NO include guard, meant to be pulled in via a
 * direct `#include "khtpm_render_core.c"` (yes, a .c file, not a
 * separate compiled+linked translation unit) - this is the only way to
 * share a real struct definition + real functions across multiple
 * standalone binaries without introducing a header. Functions stay
 * `static` (correct here, not just habit - each consumer text-includes
 * this file into its OWN translation unit, so `static` keeps these
 * symbols private to each resulting binary, exactly as if they'd been
 * hand-duplicated - which is the whole point).
 *
 * Real, verified overlap only (not assumed) - see local-2do-15.txt's own
 * "Stage 2 real-architecture finding" entry for how each piece here was
 * checked before being moved:
 *   - Elem struct: db-hq/chat-hai were already identical (incl. onclick/
 *     parent); events-hq's was a strict subset (never used those two
 *     fields) - the fuller struct here is a safe superset, not a
 *     behavior change for events-hq.
 *   - MAX_CHILDREN: was 32 in events-hq, 64 in db-hq/chat-hai - unified
 *     on 64 (more headroom, not a behavior change).
 *   - hit_test(): was BYTE-IDENTICAL across all 3 already (pure Elem
 *     geometry, zero X11/global dependency).
 *   - find_by_tag()/find_by_id(): functionally identical (whitespace
 *     differences only).
 *
 * Scope note: draw_elem()/render_tree() are NOT here yet (Stage 2b,
 * deferred) - they depend on each app's own dpy/screen/buf/gc/
 * xftdraw_buf/cmap X11 globals, and matching those exactly across all 3
 * files needs its own real verification pass before sharing, per
 * khtpm-merge-how2.md's own caution on this class of coupling.
 *
 * Real single-binary end goal (per direct instruction, confirmed
 * 2026-08-16 - wraith_parser_alpha.+x IS the standard: one generic
 * binary, argv[1] = .chtpm path, project.pdl resolved from convention,
 * ZERO per-app hardcoded C logic): db-hq/events-hq/chat-hai each still
 * have real, different, hardcoded business logic in C today (chat-hai's
 * session/ledger loading, events-hq's event.ir.pdl page/command
 * parsing, db-hq's common_events listing) - none of that is data-driven
 * yet, so they're still 3 separate binaries for now. This file is the
 * real-.c-sharing step BEFORE that bigger, separately-planned
 * single-binary migration - see local-2do-15.txt.
 *
 * Convention: same directory as khtpm_css_parser.c/.h and
 * stb_image_write.h (see README.md) - source-of-truth only, NOT a shared
 * runtime include path. Each consumer's build_*.sh copies this file into
 * its own ops/ dir before compiling (same `cp` shape as the other files
 * here), then the consumer's own .c does `#include "khtpm_render_core.c"`
 * - NOT added to the $CC command line as a separate translation unit
 * (unlike khtpm_css_parser.c, which IS compiled+linked separately - this
 * file is text-included instead, specifically to avoid needing a header
 * for the struct definition). Add a
 * `cp "$SHARED/khtpm_render_core.c" khtpm_render_core.c` line to any new
 * consumer's build script - don't hand-copy this file again. */

/* REAL START 2026-08-16, Stage 3 (khtpm-merge-how2.md §5) - real box-
 * model/flex layout engine, built against the real 9-pattern inventory
 * in that doc's own §5.1b (all 3 real consumers' current layout_pass()
 * functions read in full first, not guessed). Lives HERE (not
 * khtpm_css_parser.c) because it operates on Elem, which only exists in
 * this file - khtpm_css_parser.c knows nothing about trees, only flat
 * per-element style computation (css_compute_style()).
 *
 * REAL, DELIBERATE DESIGN CONSTRAINT: this engine has ZERO access to
 * real text measurement (Xft/font state is each app's own X11 global,
 * not available at this shared-library level - see §5.1b pattern #2's
 * own "measure_text_px()" note). Real contract: for any child whose
 * real size should be its OWN NATURAL/measured content size (pattern
 * #2's tab labels, footer buttons, etc) rather than an explicit CSS
 * width/height, the CALLER must pre-populate that child's own e->w/e->h
 * (via measure_text_px() or equivalent) BEFORE calling this function on
 * its PARENT. This function treats an already-nonzero e->w/e->h as the
 * real natural size for any child with no explicit style.has_width/
 * has_height and no flex_grow - it never re-measures text.
 *
 * Real contract for position:absolute children (§5.1b pattern #5's
 * <title> case): skipped entirely from normal flex flow (matches every
 * real app's own existing `continue` in this exact spot today),
 * positioned at parent_origin + top/left offset instead, using
 * whatever e->w/e->h the caller already set (same pre-measured-size
 * contract as above - position:absolute doesn't change that).
 *
 * Real contract for flex_grow (§5.1b pattern #3): a child with
 * style.has_flex_grow set consumes a real weighted share of whatever
 * main-axis space is left after every fixed/natural-sized sibling is
 * accounted for - matches db-hq/events-hq's own real "sidebar fixed,
 * panel gets the remainder" pattern with flex_grow:1 on the panel.
 *
 * Real contract for block (non-flex, the default): children are left
 * completely untouched by this function - matches every real app's own
 * existing pattern of positioning some elements by hand outside the
 * normal stacking flow (chat-hai's own phantom settings elements,
 * §5.1b pattern #9) - the engine only recurses into real flex
 * containers, it does not silently reposition things a caller
 * deliberately manages itself.
 *
 * NOT YET LIVE-TESTED against a real app as of this write - see

     * full screen isn't working... window is bigger but browser window
     * is in small window in big window") - live-confirmed via a PNG
     * dump: chrome/border tracked the new fullscreen size correctly,
     * but the flex-laid-out content (sidebar/nb-body/nb-console, the
     * only window in the house using this css_layout_pass() flex path
     * directly on its <page>) stayed frozen at its very first-ever
     * size. Root cause: an element with no CSS width/height used to
     * fall back to keeping its OWN PREVIOUS e->w/e->h if already
     * nonzero, instead of the fresh avail_w/avail_h this call was
     * just given - so avail_w only ever "won" on the very first pass
     * (e->w starts at 0), and every later relayout (a window resize,
     * fullscreen toggle, or any future live resize) silently kept the
     * original size forever. avail_w/avail_h IS this element's real,
     * current, authoritative size for this pass (computed by whichever
     * caller invoked this function, be it the top-level layout_
     * sidebar_panel() with g_win_w or a flex-parent handing down a
     * proportioned child size a few lines below) - always use it when

/* bv_menu_input - board-viewer's own input dispatcher.
 *
 * REWRITE 2026-08-02 (see &.widgits/interact-fix-widget.txt for the
 * full investigation): the P6 pass above was WRONG about how
 * mutaclysm's real xlector-entry mechanism works. It is NOT a plain
 * numbered METHOD row dispatched by this op - "INTERACT" is a
 * RESERVED command string chtpm_parser_pal.c itself special-cases
 * (confirmed via direct code read: onClick="INTERACT" on a real,
 * hand-written <button> element, exactly like mutaclysm's own
 * game.chtpm:7 "Control Hero" button - now mirrored in board_viewer.
 * chtpm). The engine ITSELF owns the entire mode lifecycle: setting
 * active_index on click, remapping+relaying raw arrow keys (1000-1003)
 * into interact_relay.txt ONLY while that element is engaged, handling
 * ESC-exit before any project op ever runs, and swapping the [>]/[^]
 * focus glyph - none of that is this op's job anymore, and a plain
 * piece.pdl METHOD row can NEVER trigger it (${piece_methods} rows
 * always become onClick="KEY:N", never the literal reserved string).
 *
 * Consequence: this op no longer needs (or has) any nav_mode flag,
 * gating, or ESC handling of its own. It is only ever invoked with an
 * arrow-key code (1000-1003) while genuinely inside real INTERACT mode
 * (the engine guarantees that), so arrow handling here is
 * unconditional - the gate already happened upstream.
 *
 * ADDED 2026-08-03, direct user correction ("controls like [hero
 * actions] shouldn't be available till interact mode is activated in
 * gl map view like civ etc"): any key that reaches this op AT ALL is
 * already, by construction (per this file's own header above),
 * genuinely inside real INTERACT/nav mode - render_mode==1 is also
 * checked explicitly below before this new dispatch, so it can never
 * fire from the flat 2D pre-nav-mode state either. Any key not
 * consumed by camera controls above now falls through to a real
 * widget->host verb send: looks up the FOCUSED host's own real
 * pieces/system/keybinds.txt (same file @.apps/piececraft-xyz/ops/
 * pc_menu_input.c's own header comment describes - this is the
 * board-viewer-side half of that mechanism) for this keycode, and if
 * found, appends the resolved ACTION NAME to that host's own real
 * inbox (declared via its own pieces/system/board_widget_bridge.txt,
 * same bridge/inbox mechanism civ-txt/tactics-txt already use for
 * OPEN_BOARD_WIDGET reuse). civ-txt/tactics-txt don't ship a
 * keybinds.txt, so this is a real no-op for them - only a host that
 * publishes one (piececraft-xyz) ever gets anything sent.
 *
 * Self-contained, no shared headers.
 * Usage: bv_menu_input.+x <keycode> */

     * (KEY:5/KEY:6).

     * REAL ARCHITECTURE CORRECTION (2026-08-30, direct instruction:
     * "isn't it only that actual 2d/3d screen needs to be blitted?
     * everything else can be just a typical hq window") - File/Desk
     * still dispatch through this same real relay (khtpm's own File/
     * Desk Elems call pchq_append_key() directly on click/Enter now,
     * instead of a board_viewer.chtpm button existing for the legacy
     * engine's own click-hit-testing to find - same end result here,
     * unchanged). Close moved OUT of this file entirely - it's now a
     * pure local khtpm action (no cross-process relay needed at all,
     * since closing the khtpm chrome window is 100% local to that
     * process) - the real flag-file mechanism this used is gone. */

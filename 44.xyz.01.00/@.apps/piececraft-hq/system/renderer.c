/* renderer - standalone frame display, no ncurses.
 *
 * REAL BUG, FIXED 2026-07-19 (direct user report/request - "instead of
 * refreshing the screen each time it would simply show old frame in
 * terminal and allow me to scroll up... fix the way things are
 * rendered to read from frame the way fuzz-op does in 1.tpmos"):
 * every local copy of this file across the whole family (checked
 * directly - wsr-pal/pal-forum/pal-chain/zoo_0000 all had the same
 * shape) UNCONDITIONALLY cleared the screen (`\033[H\033[J`) on every
 * frame - real TPMOS's own `pieces/display/renderer.c` does NOT do
 * this by default. Its own `is_history_on()` defaults ON (the flag
 * file, `pieces/display/state.txt`, doesn't even need to exist - a
 * missing file also means "on"), and in that (default) mode it prints
 * 5 blank lines + a `--- FRAME UPDATE at <ts> ---` marker, then the
 * frame content PLAIN - no ANSI clear, no cursor repositioning at all,
 * relying entirely on the terminal's own normal scrollback. The
 * clear-screen path only exists as the OFF-mode fallback. Ported that
 * real shape here directly rather than guessing at one.
 *
 * Mirrors the real TPMOS pattern (pieces/display/renderer.c): polls a
 * pulse marker file's SIZE (never mtime), and on growth, prints
 * pieces/display/current_frame.txt to stdout - a normal cooked-mode
 * terminal write, no raw mode needed here (only keyboard_input needs
 * raw mode).
 *
 * Every frame it draws is also appended, with a timestamp, to
 * pieces/display/frame_history.txt - an auditable, plain-text log of
 * every frame the game has ever shown, so a frame can be verified by
 * reading a file instead of driving a pty.
 *
 * Self-contained: own root resolution, own constants, no shared
 * headers. Exits when pieces/system/quit_flag.txt becomes non-empty
 * (written by keyboard_input on Ctrl+C).
 *
 * MARKER SIMPLIFIED TO SINGLE (mass-refactor 2026-07-26, matching
 * 101.mutaclsym, canonical reference per direct user decision:
 * "mutaclsym is most advanced, and is flicker free so use that as
 * reference"). This file used to also watch frame_changed.txt; real
 * TPMOS's own chtpm_parser.c appends to renderer_pulse.txt
 * unconditionally at its single compose_frame() write point, on every
 * transition including href, so renderer_pulse.txt alone is
 * authoritative - see 01.muchi-pals-🥚️-13.01/system/renderer.c's own,
 * more detailed version of this same comment for the full verification.
 *
 * SKIP-IF-UNCHANGED (same pass, direct user request: "keep scrolling.
 * but only render new frame change from marker file"): a pulse marker
 * growing doesn't guarantee current_frame.txt's CONTENT actually
 * differs from what was last printed. Skip printing (and the
 * frame_history.txt entry) entirely when it doesn't. */

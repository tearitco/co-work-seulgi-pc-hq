/* gl_mirror - the ONLY file in mutaclsym allowed to call GL/GLUT
 * primitives, per 2.muchi-verse/GRAND-ARCHITECTURE.md's GOVERNING
 * CONSTRAINT (prisc+x's long-term RISC-V-compilation goal means our own
 * code must never depend on GL primitives - only this one minimal
 * reader, ported near-unmodified from real 1.TPMOS
 * projects/wraith-alpha/ops/wraith_gl.c, is exempt). Its entire job:
 * poll ops/compose_rgb_frame.+x's output file
 * (pieces/display/rgb_frame.raw, a raw RGBA32 buffer - zero GL calls
 * went into producing those bytes) and blit it as one textured quad.
 *
 * Deliberately stripped down from wraith_gl.c's 799 lines: dropped
 * everything specific to wraith-alpha-desktop's multi-window manager -
 * mouse hit-testing (hit_test_semantic_action), click-to-activate
 * (emit_mouse_event/pending-action), window-drag calibration
 * (#.mouse-offset.txt / apply_mouse_offset), project command history.
 * mutaclsym has no window manager and no semantic-object click targets
 * to hit-test against - this window is a mirror, not a desktop.
 *
 * Keyboard forwarding and the focus-lock file (see below) were
 * INITIALLY dropped too, on the assumption OS window-focus alone would
 * keep the terminal and this GL window from double-writing into the
 * same input stream. Corrected after finding real 1.TPMOS's
 * pieces/joystick/plugins/joystick_input.c - both it AND
 * pieces/keyboard/plugins/keyboard_input.c explicitly check a shared
 * pieces/apps/gl_os/session/input_focus.lock file
 * (gl_os_has_focus()) before writing to the shared history file,
 * rather than trusting window-manager focus routing - a joystick
 * reading a raw /dev/input/js0 device has no concept of "window focus"
 * at all, so the lock file is the actual, load-bearing mechanism, not
 * a redundant belt-and-suspenders check. gl_desktop.c also has a real
 * glutJoystickFunc(joystick, 50) - so the full pattern is: GL owns
 * joystick/keyboard directly via GLUT callbacks while it holds the
 * lock; standalone terminal/joystick-reader processes back off while
 * it's held. This file now does its half of that: writes the lock on
 * startup, removes it via atexit(), and forwards keyboard input the
 * same way wraith_gl.c's own keyboard()/special_keyboard() do (see
 * this file's own append_key()/map_special_key()).
 * system/keyboard_input.c was updated to check the same lock.
 * Joystick itself (a real, separate process in 1.TPMOS, not part of
 * the GL file) is not yet ported here - tracked as later work, real
 * hardware needed to test against.
 *
 * What's KEPT, byte-for-byte in shape:
 *   - checksum_buffer() - identical FNV-1a-64 algorithm to
 *     ops/compose_rgb_frame.c's own copy (see that file's header) and
 *     to wraith_gl.c's, so a checksum computed by any of the three is
 *     directly comparable.
 *   - load_texture() / display() - the actual "mirror" content: read
 *     the raw file, upload via glTexImage2D, draw ONE glBegin(GL_QUADS)
 *     textured quad, glutSwapBuffers(). No other GL drawing anywhere.
 *   - timer() - polls the source file's mtime/size every 16ms and
 *     reloads on change. wraith_gl.c polls a SEPARATE trigger file
 *     (WRAITH_FRAME_TRIGGER) that its rgb daemon touches on every new
 *     frame; mutaclsym has no such pulse-file convention yet, so this
 *     polls rgb_frame.raw's own stat() directly instead (mtime OR size
 *     change) - one file fewer to keep in sync, same detection effect.
 *   - the receipt-writing pattern the user directly asked be ported:
 *     write_gl_display_receipt(), called from the same three sites
 *     wraith_gl.c calls it from (texture_upload, display_swap,
 *     reshape) - so this pipeline's correctness (did a real texture
 *     upload happen, what did it check-sum to, does that match what
 *     compose_rgb_frame.c said it wrote) can be confirmed by reading a
 *     text file, never by looking at the window. */

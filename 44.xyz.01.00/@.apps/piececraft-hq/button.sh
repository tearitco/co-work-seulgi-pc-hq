# xyz's own game session dies WITHOUT its board-viewer widget also
# dying (crash, force-kill, or simply Ctrl+C not reaching the widget's
# own separate process group), the orphaned widget stays alive and gets
# silently REFOCUSED (not respawned) by the next OPEN_BOARD_WIDGET press
# - correct per the per-project scoping fix, but invisible to the user
# if that orphaned window isn't already on top, which looks exactly
# like "the board didn't open." Two-layer real fix: kill any surviving
# same-scope widget on START (safety net for a prior crash) AND on
# QUIT (so a clean Ctrl+C never leaves one behind in the first place).
# pkill -f matches the widget's own real invocation command line

/* pc_clock_daemon - real PERSISTENT game-clock process, direct port of
 * the house's own real precedent: #.ref/Mar$.$treetRace]Q]k32]4K/
 * wsr_clock.c (read in full 2026-08-04, direct instruction). Same real
 * per-real-millisecond rate table, same real continuous background
 * loop (CLOCK_MONOTONIC + usleep, NOT tied to any per-render/per-
 * keypress trigger) - the REAL fix for "time isn't ticking when I'm
 * not pressing keys": pc_compose_frame.c's own advance_game_clock()
 * only ever ran REACTIVELY (on a render), so a session with no input
 * had a genuinely frozen clock no matter how much real time passed.
 * This daemon ticks on its own, exactly like the real reference.
 *
 * Adapted to piececraft-hq's own real schema (world_01/state.txt's
 * own game_time_epoch_sec/autotick_enabled/autotick_speed fields,
 * whole-seconds epoch instead of the reference's own separate y/m/d/h/
 * m/s/cs fields - this project's own real display already derives the
 * calendar breakdown via strftime, no need to track it separately)
 * rather than a byte-for-byte port - real precedent for the TIMING
 * MODEL (continuous daemon, same rate table), not a literal copy of
 * every field.
 *
 * Real, additional piece the reference doesn't have: this daemon ALSO
 * advances the real world tick counter + calls tick_animals() (same
 * mechanic every player action already triggers) once per real GAME
 * MINUTE crossed - the reference's own file has no concept of "world
 * tick"/NPCs at all, that's piececraft-hq's own real addition on top.
 *
 * Self-contained, no shared headers.
 * Usage: pc_clock_daemon.+x (no args, runs forever until SIGTERM/SIGINT) */

/* pc_generate_chunk - real Phase 1 chunk terrain generation, per

 * (so a compressed chunk can regenerate identically later, per design
 * §2's own decompression requirement) - uses a real seeded-per-
 * coordinate integer hash, NOT raw srand(time()) (design §6's own
 * explicit callout: civ-txt's CONFIRM_START uses srand(time()) for
 * ONE-TIME generation, intentionally non-reproducible there - that
 * would break chunk regeneration here).
 *
 * P1 scope: ONE chunk (chunk_0_0), ONE biome (plains: grass surface,
 * dirt subsurface, stone below, air above) - no biome variety, no
 * trees/ore scatter yet (design §11: "terrain gen for ONE biome...
 * prove the render/nav loop" is the whole Phase 1 bar). 16x16 chunk,
 * 32 Z-layers (civ-vs-piece.md §2 decisions).
 *
 * Also writes pieces/world_01/state.txt (seed/tick/active) and
 * pieces/hero_01/state.txt (real entity, universal schema per
 * PORTABLE_ENTITY_ARCHITECTURE.md §3, placed standing on the newly
 * generated surface at the chunk's own center column) - co-located
 * here since both need the SAME computed surface height this op
 * already produces, avoiding duplicate height logic in a second op.

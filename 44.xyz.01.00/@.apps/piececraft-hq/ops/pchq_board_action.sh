# The action= side of pchq-board.xhtpm. Ports run_pchq_board_mode()'s
# input forwarding: everything the toolbar / File / Desk rows do is
# appending the right byte(s) to the board-viewer session's own two
# history files (never reimplementing the engine's key handling).

#   file <row>       pick File row (default-pdl / default-legacy)
#                    engage if needed, '5' if row != active, then RESTORE
#   desk <row>       reload the board: engage if needed, '6', then RESTORE
#
# RESTORE (2026-09-07 fix): file/desk used to engage Interact Mode and
# never turn it back off - if you clicked File/Desk while NOT already in
# Interact Mode you were left trapped in it (the renderer forwards every
# key, incl. arrows, to the game while it's on, so khtpm nav appears
# frozen/stuck on the File item). Now: only auto-engage if it was off,
# and afterward toggle it back off iff this call turned it on and it is
# still on (live re-checked, so an engine-side exit is never
# double-toggled). Board is left in a nav-usable state either way.
#
# The renderer's dispatch() appends '<pkg_dir>' '<house_root>' as two
# trailing args - ignored here.

        # load 'maps+logic', that will need to be fixed" - confirmed by
        # direct code read: the OLD version of this verb copied the
        # picked map.txt to chunk_0_0_z0.txt and wrote board_config.txt,
        # then injected key 54 - but pc_menu_input.c has NO handler for
        # key 54 at all, and nothing anywhere reads chunk_0_0_z0.txt or
        # board_config.txt back. Both files were pure dead writes.
        #
        # The one real, working map-load path is pc_menu_input.c's own
        # CONFIRM_START_MAP:<map_id> inbox command (EVENT-TRIGGER-LAYER-
        # PLAN.md §3 Step 3), which calls pc_generate_chunk.+x with a
        # real `map:<id>` argv - confirmed by direct code read, and
        # explicitly left "no menu button wired up yet" in its own
        # comment. This verb is that wiring. Real, honest behavior
        # difference from what the old dead code implied: this starts a
        # genuinely NEW world generated from the picked map (same as
        # the New Game map-select flow), not a live in-place swap of
        # the current session's chunk data - no live-reload mechanism
        # exists in the engine at all, so this doesn't pretend to have
        # one. Drained on the very next tick regardless of a keypress -
        # pc_menu_input.+x is polled every tick with key=0 when idle and
        # always drains the inbox first (confirmed by direct code read),
        # so no engage_if_needed/append_key/restore_interact dance is

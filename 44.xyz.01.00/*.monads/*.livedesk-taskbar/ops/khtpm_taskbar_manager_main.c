/* khtpm_taskbar_manager_main.c — standalone "manager driver" binary.
 *
 * Per khtpm-strip-parser-design.md §5 decisions ("Binary split: manager
 * keeps KtbState + the file-relay loop only"): this is the CHTPM-manager
 * side of the new two-process strip architecture. It owns a KtbState
 * (reusing khtpm_taskbar_manager.c/.h completely unmodified — see that
 * file's header comment, this is done/live-verified logic, not touched
 * here), polls a bare-decimal-per-line strip_history.txt relay file the
 * new khtpm_strip_parser.c writes into, dispatches each code into the
 * existing ktb_* API, and on any state mutation writes strip_state.txt
 * (pipe-delimited, matching the house .pdl convention) plus appends a
 * single marker byte to strip_frame_changed.txt (mirroring CHTPM's own
 * frame_changed.txt touch-signal, see chtpm_parser.c's four `fopen(...,
 * "a")` appenders).
 *
 * This binary has ZERO platform/Xlib calls — pure logic + file relay,
 * exactly the shape the design's decisions section calls for.

/* REAL FIX 2026-09-01, direct instruction ("we really dont make .h
 * files... u could move that into the .c with ease") - khtpm_strip_
 * codes.h inlined verbatim (was a real, genuine #include shared with
 * khtpm_core_render.c's own strip mode; that side already carries this
 * same content verbatim per its own "khtpm_strip_codes.h, verbatim"
 * comment, so the header itself was left with exactly one real
 * consumer - this file - and no reason left to exist as its own file).
 *
 * khtpm_strip_codes.h — shared decimal action-code protocol between
 * the strip's own real click/key resolution (khtpm_core_render.c's
 * strip_main(), writer) and this file (reader, polls
 * strip_history.txt and dispatches into the existing ktb_* manager
 * API).
 *
 * Per khtpm-strip-parser-design.md §2 ("Keys in"), the wire format on
 * strip_history.txt is CHTPM's own real convention: one bare decimal
 * integer per line ("%d\n"), no prefix. This is the single place both
 * sides agree on what each integer means.
 *
 * Judgment call (not specified field-by-field in the design doc):
 * CHTPM's own history.txt carries raw X keycodes/ASCII, so low values
 * (0-127) are reserved for literal ASCII (digit chars '0'-'9' =
 * 48-57, BackSpace = 8, Return = 13, Escape = 27 — the same codes
 * XLookupString/XLookupKeysym already normalize to). Values >= 1000
 * are strip-specific resolved actions (arrow-equivalents, tab clicks,
 * shortcut clicks, close) that have no natural single-byte ASCII code,
 * using the same "resolved action, not raw coordinates" shape. */

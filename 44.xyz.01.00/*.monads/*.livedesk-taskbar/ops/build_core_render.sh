# REAL FIX 2026-09-01 - khtpm_taskbar_manager.c dropped from this link
# line: real, confirmed dead (the ktb_init()/ktb_quit_and_save() calls
# this used to exist for were already removed from khtpm_core_render.c
# in an earlier pass this same session; this file builds and links
# clean without it). Also the real house standard, per khtpm-merge-
# how2.md's own "HOUSE STANDARD" section and confirmed directly again
# this session: no cross-.c linking to share behavior within one
# binary - genuinely the same file, or a separate fork/exec+file-IPC
# process (khtpm_taskbar_manager_main.+x's own real, separate compile
# of khtpm_taskbar_manager.c is that legitimate case, untouched).

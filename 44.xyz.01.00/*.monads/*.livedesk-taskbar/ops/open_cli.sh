#
# REAL BUG FIX 2026-08-18, found live-testing the HQ menu's "cli" row:
# `gnome-terminal -- <path>` execve()s <path> DIRECTLY - it never invokes
# a shell for that argument, so this project's own real, literal directory
# names containing '*' characters (*.monads/*.livedesk-taskbar) were never
# resolved (confirmed live: "Failed to execute child process
# '*.monads/*.livedesk-taskbar/...': Failed to execve: No such file or
# directory"). Same real fix shape as run_khtpm_strip.sh already uses
# (SCRIPT_DIR via $0, not a glob relied on at the exec site) - this script
# itself IS still invoked the same glob-relative way "$.restart"'s own row
# already does (proven working, since sh -c genuinely DOES glob-expand
# before invoking a real script), it just resolves the FINAL binary path
# from its own $0 once running, so gnome-terminal never sees a wildcard.
#
# REAL ARCHITECTURE FIX 2026-08-18, direct user report ("its still
# staggered... it should display from a .txt frame file like tpmos"): the
# original single combined binary (khtpm_strip_renderer_ascii.+x, retired)
# did BOTH raw-termios keyboard input AND stdout rendering in one process -
# raw mode disables OPOST, breaking \n->\r\n translation for its own
# printf output (a real, visible staircase). TPMOS's real architecture
# never combines these: system/renderer.c never touches termios, system/
# keyboard_input.c never prints. Split into two binaries here to match -
# khtpm_strip_render_ascii.+x (backgrounded, no termios, writes+displays a
# real .txt frame file) and khtpm_strip_keyboard_ascii.+x (foreground, raw
# termios, never prints) - same real shape mutaclysm's own button.sh
# already uses (`./system/renderer &` then foreground `./system/
# keyboard_input`), not a new pattern.

# macOS leg (2026-08-22): no gnome-terminal here. Same renderer-&-
# keyboard-fg split, hosted by Terminal.app via a throwaway .command
# wrapper (Terminal executes .command files directly; a temp copy keeps
# star-names and quoting out of the osascript/Tell layer entirely).
# Two binaries in one terminal, TPMOS renderer/keyboard split (unchanged
# shape - see khtpm_strip_render_ascii.c's header for why they're never
# combined). 2026-09-06: the composing is now done by khtpm_core_render.c
# (dock_write_ascii_frame() in redraw(), writes strip_ascii_current_
# frame.txt); khtpm_strip_render_ascii.+x is now just the terminal
# PRESENTER (polls that file, prints each line with explicit \r\n +
# screen-clear so a shared raw-mode tty can't staircase it).
# khtpm_strip_keyboard_ascii.+x relays keys to strip_history.txt (the
# relay the manager's poll_strip_history() consumes).

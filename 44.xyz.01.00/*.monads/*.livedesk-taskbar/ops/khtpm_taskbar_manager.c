     * erased the curated startup list and collapsed later resets. Keep
     * the close behavior, but do not rewrite $.crypts/autostart.pdl

     * a real problem from it, and deliberately removed it — khtpm's port
     * had regressed back to the pre-fix behavior. This is also the actual
     * root cause of a symptom patched earlier tonight (the stale tool-bar

 * (the file that decides the taskbar's own tab list) was being

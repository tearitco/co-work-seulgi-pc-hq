#
# REAL FIX 2026-09-01 - the parser half (PARSER below) is no longer its
# own binary. khtpm_strip_parser.c/khtpm_strip_layout.c/.h/
# khtpm_strip_codes.h were folded verbatim into khtpm_core_render.c as
# a new mode (strip_main(), dispatched on argc==2 - this mode's own
# real invocation shape is exactly <house_root>, no .chtpm path, unlike
# every other mode that binary serves). Real house-standard
# consolidation this session: no cross-.c linking/#include to share
# behavior across binaries - genuinely the same file, or fork/exec+
# file-IPC (the manager, khtpm_taskbar_manager_main.+x, stays exactly
# that - a real, separate, unrelated process). khtpm_pids() below can
# no longer just pgrep the old binary NAME (khtpm_core_render.+x now
# also serves every HQ app window) - it scans /proc directly for a
# real strip-mode invocation: argv[0] matching khtpm_core_render AND
# exactly one argument after it (this mode's own real, exactly-2-argc
# shape - every other mode always has a 2nd argv, a .chtpm path).
#
# Encapsulates the exact safe kill/build/launch/verify cycle used by hand
# all through the 2026-08-11 build-out session: never trust a bare exit
# code for a backgrounded X11 GUI launch, always confirm real PIDs via
# pgrep.
#
# 2026-08-11: legacy tp_taskbar.c retired (archived to
# *.monads/*.livedesk-taskbar/ops/LEGACY-ARCHIVE-20260811.zip, originals
# deleted). Binaries dropped their "_test" suffix now that khtpm is the
# real, only taskbar. The `legacy`/`restore` action this script used to
# have (relaunch tp_taskbar.c as a fallback) is gone — there is no legacy
# binary left to relaunch.

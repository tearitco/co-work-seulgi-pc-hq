/* khtpm_strip_render_ascii.c — terminal ASCII renderer for the taskbar,
 * matching TPMOS's real pieces/display/renderer.c AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE:
 * NO termios, NO raw mode, NO stdin reading at all - a plain cooked-mode
 * stdout printer, nothing else.
 *
 * REAL BUG FIX 2026-08-18, direct user report ("its still staggered, and
 * i dont see '>' nav in the staggered brackets" - a real terminal
 * screenshot showed every line progressively MORE indented than the last,
 * a classic staircase pattern): the PREVIOUS version of this feature
 * (khtpm_strip_renderer_ascii.c, now retired) combined rendering AND raw-
 * termios keyboard input in ONE process. enable_raw_mode() there disabled
 * OPOST (matching keyboard_input.c's own real flags) - and termios raw
 * mode is a property of the TTY ITSELF, not the calling process, so once
 * OPOST was cleared, EVERY printf("\n") to that same terminal (including
 * this same process's own frame output) stopped auto-translating to
 * "\r\n" - each bare \n just moved down a line WITHOUT returning to
 * column 0, producing exactly the observed staircase. Direct user
 * question that found the real root cause: "it should display from a
 * .txt frame file like tpmos. didn't u see that in tpmos render frame
 * pipeline?" - TPMOS's real renderer.c (confirmed via direct read) NEVER
 * touches termios at all; only keyboard_input.c does, and it never
 * prints. Splitting into two binaries here isn't a style choice, it's
 * what actually eliminates the bug's root cause: this file's stdout is
 * NEVER shared with a raw-mode-configured tty from its own code, and even
 * though it inherits the SAME tty keyboard_input.c puts into raw mode
 * when run alongside it (open_cli.sh launches both against one terminal,
 * same as mutaclysm's button.sh), TPMOS's own real precedent proves that
 * shape works correctly in practice - so this file additionally emits
 * "\r\n" explicitly (belt-and-suspenders, cheap insurance against the
 * shared-tty raw-mode case) rather than relying on OPOST at all.
 *
 * Reads:
 *   - #.desktop/strip_frame.cells.pdl          (per-cell frame data from
 *     the parser, the single source of truth for what to display)
 *   - #.desktop/strip_cells_changed.txt        (size-poll redraw trigger,
 *     dedicated to cells.pdl only — NOT the same marker the parser's own
 *     frame_changed_dirty() watches; that collision was a real bug, fixed
 *     2026-08-19, see khtpm_strip_parser.c's flush_cells_pdl())
 * Writes:
 *   - #.desktop/strip_ascii_current_frame.txt  (the composed frame TEXT,
 *     a real .txt frame file, matching TPMOS's own current_frame.txt
 *     convention)
 *   - #.desktop/strip_ascii_frame_history.txt  (auditable, timestamped
 *     history of every frame drawn, matching TPMOS's real renderer.c)
 *
 * Frame unification (2026-08-19): this renderer no longer composes its
 * own frame from livedesk_taskbar.pdl + strip_state.txt. It reads the
 * parser-produced strip_frame.cells.pdl and prints each cell's ch field.
 * The parser is the single compositor; this renderer is a dumb consumer. */
